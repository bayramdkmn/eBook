    "title": "ABOUT US",
    "paragraph1": "E-Kitap is a social cataloging and networking platform focused on books, founded in Turkey on September 1, 2024. It helps you choose your next book, allows you to meet other readers through shared reading spaces, and provides services like library booking and book inquiries. It helps you discover similar readers and authors, and lets you follow the latest updates about them.",
    "paragraph2": "On E-Kitap, readers mark the books they've read or want to read. While doing so, they can rate the books out of 5, add comments, and express their opinions. This creates profile pages for readers, books, and authors. As users socialize and share content, these profiles become richer in content for others to explore.",
    "paragraph3": "The first version of E-Kitap started development in September 2024 and was launched on June 1, 2025. Its main goal is to encourage reading, offer early insights about books, and reduce costs via book exchanges. It will continue to evolve based on user feedback."
